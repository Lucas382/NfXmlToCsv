# XmlToCsv Project Overview


#### This solution was developed in Python using the [Flet](https://flet.dev/) framework to handle <br> the needs of a  freelancer job which required a solution to convert XML files to CSV.

- My initial goal for this project was to develop a reusable project template, so the components could be used again.

- The project includes a directory selector, which allows users to choose the appropriate folder containing the xml files.

- It remembers the last folder that the user inputted to facilitate the next conversion.

- It also has an information console to track the current status of the conversion process.
>Note: A 1-second delay was applied to simulate the processing of hundreds of XML files.
